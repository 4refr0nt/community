      A Barcamp style event in Belgium.

      Let's learn about Svelte through some presentations and some coding
      together.

      Location to be decided, but probably a classroom or shared office in Ghent
      or Antwerp. If you are a school or have a location and interested in
      hosting this event, get in touch!

      Timing to be decided, probably in the coming 2-3 months. Beginning of
      December seems realistic.
